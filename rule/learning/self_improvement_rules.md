## Rule 1: Error Analysis and Learning
When encountering errors or failures, use the `error_analysis` tool to identify patterns and root causes. Log all errors with context for future reference.

## Rule 2: Feedback Loop Implementation
Implement continuous feedback loops using the `feedback_loop` tool. Every action should be evaluated for success/failure and used to improve future behavior.

## Rule 3: Parallel Processing
Use `parallel_processing` tool for handling multiple tasks simultaneously. This improves efficiency and allows for comprehensive analysis of multiple outcomes.

## Rule 4: Batch Operations with Reversibility
When performing batch operations, use the `batch_operations` tool with built-in rollback capabilities. Always maintain the ability to revert changes based on feedback.

## Rule 5: Historical Data Utilization
Leverage historical data from previous operations to inform current decisions. Use past successes and failures to predict outcomes and optimize behavior.

## Rule 6: Traceability and Adjustability
All actions must be traceable and adjustable. Maintain detailed logs of operations, decisions, and outcomes for future analysis and improvement.

## Rule 7: Continuous Evolution
The system should evolve over time through iterative learning. Use feedback from all operations to refine algorithms, decision-making processes, and tool usage patterns.

## Rule 8: Life Cycle Management
Follow the complete life cycle: ทำงาน (work) -> เจอเออเร่อ (encounter error) -> แก้ไขเออเร่อ (fix error) -> ปรับปรุงความสามารถ (improve capabilities) -> เรียนรู้จากlogging (learn from logs) -> suggest (provide suggestions).

## Rule 9: Error-First Approach
When errors occur, prioritize error analysis before attempting fixes. Use historical data to predict similar errors and prevent them.

## Rule 10: Proactive Learning
Continuously analyze logs and operation history to identify improvement opportunities before errors occur.
